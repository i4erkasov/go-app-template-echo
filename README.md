# Go DDD CQRS layout

This is a Go application template utilizing Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) principles with the Echo framework.

## Component Descriptions

### `cmd`
Contains the application's entry point (`main.go`), where the server is started and all necessary components are initialized.

### `internal`
The core of the application, divided into layers according to DDD and CQRS.

#### `application`
The application layer, responsible for coordinating actions and delegating tasks between the domain layer and the infrastructure layer. Includes command and query processing.

#### `domain`
The heart of the domain model, containing business logic, entities, aggregates, repository interfaces, and domain services.

#### `infrastructure`
The layer that facilitates communication between the application layer and the external world (databases, web services, etc.). Includes API implementation, database access, etc.

### `pkg`
General packages for the entire application, e.g., the logging service.
