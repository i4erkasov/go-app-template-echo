# Packages

The `pkg` directory contains shared libraries and packages that can be used across the entire application. These packages provide common functionality, utility functions, and third-party library abstractions to promote reusability and maintainability.

## Description

Each package within the `pkg` directory is designed to be independent and reusable, potentially even across different projects. The aim is to keep these packages decoupled from the specific business logic of the application, focusing instead on providing general-purpose functionality. This approach helps in maintaining clean architecture principles by segregating core application logic from common utility functions.
